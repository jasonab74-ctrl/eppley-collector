pubmed,35381058,Evolving Clinical Experiences in Aesthetic Hip Implant Body Contouring.,Aesthetic surgery journal,2022,Robert J Troell; Barry Eppley; Shahin Javaheri,10.1093/asj/sjac064,"Hip augmentation increases the hip width utilizing fat transfer and/or subcutaneous implants, creating a more feminine hourglass shape. Custom hip implant surgery requires proper patient selection, correct body frame analysis, appreciation of hip aesthetics, understanding surgical anatomy, optimal aesthetic planning, a favorable implant design and fabrication, skilled surgical implant placement, diligent postoperative patient care, and proper complication management. The authors sought to evaluate the pioneering clinical experience with cosmetic custom hip silastic implants. A consecutive patient surgical series of patients seeking custom aesthetic hip implant surgery was tabulated. Similar hip analysis, implant design and fabrication, surgical technique, and postoperative follow-up were performed in 3 practices. The overall patient satisfaction rate (87%, 47 of 54 patients) was favorable. There was a total of 29 (54%) medical complications and 20 (37%) cosmetic complications (implant show). A total of 17 patients (31.5%) requested revision surgery secondary to implant show (n = 10) and an infected implant (n = 6). No patient experienced an acute implant infection, incisional scar hypertrophy, wound dehiscence, implant extrusion, parasthesias, muscle dysfunction, or hip joint injury. The utilization of hip implants represents a new type of body contouring implant that has some unique differences in anatomic location, implant design, and tissue pocket location. Their utilization is an evolving one in aesthetic body implants, for which clinical experience to date remains limited in number. The proper surgical placement, postoperative management, and treatment of complications to include revision surgery are essential to achieving a successful body contouring outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35381058/

Treatment is, however, medical, with delay leading to significant morbidity. In addition, medical workup for coincident disorders has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that pediatric PG has differing disease associations and therefore requires a differing medical workup. The National Inpatient Sample and the Kids' Inpatient Database were used to identify all hospitalized patients with PG. PG patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases-9 code and divided into adults and children. For each age group, the PG patients were compared with non-PG patients. The Breslow-Day test was used to determine the relationship between PG and associated diagnoses. There were 204 of 7,384,591 children and 10,154 of 89,674,318 adults with PG. Both adult and pediatric PG patients were more likely to be female and have arteritis, arthropathy, and colitis. The PG children had a significantly greater odds ratio for having arteritis, arthropathy, and colitis but not malignancy when compared to adults. This is the largest study of PG in adult and child populations. It validates the associations known regarding adult PG while demonstrating that pediatric PG is much more highly associated with gastroenterologic, rheumatologic, and vascular issues and less likely to be coincident with malignancy. These differences demonstrate a need to approach the disease differently in the pediatric population, with regard to associated diagnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27916349/

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of tongue stitches and nasal trumpets that have been used in an attempt to prevent this complication. An 8-year (2005 to 2013) retrospective review of palatoplasties performed at a tertiary care center was conducted. Patients were divided into three groups: those with no airway protective measure, those with a tongue stitch only, and a group with nasal trumpet and tongue stitch. Recorded variables included sex, age, Veau classification, and comorbidities. Primary outcomes measured were postoperative respiratory distress, readmission, and reoperation rates. Fifty-eight patients underwent palatoplasties with no airway protective measure, 252 patients had tongue stitch only, and 87 had tongue stitch and nasal trumpet. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to comorbidities except that cleft lip was more prevalent in the no-airway protection group than in the other two groups (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the incidence of reintubation, intensive care unit transfer, surgery-related readmissions, or reoperation. Respiratory complications were significantly increased in the nasal trumpet group even after adjusting for age and weight. Length of stay was also significantly (p < 0.01) shortened when comparing no airway protection to those who underwent both nasal trumpet and tongue suture placement. The use of a tongue stitch, with or without nasal trumpet, did not correlate with improved safety and outcomes. Patients without these airway protective measures had a shorter hospital stay.

This study conducted a systematic review to derive evidence-based recommendations concerning the safest type of pocket location (sub-muscular, subfascial, intramuscular, or intramuscular XYZ method) for silicone implants in terms of acute and long-term complication rates. Articles from medline that met predetermined criteria were included in the study. The outcomes of interest included wound dehiscence, wound infection, seroma, hematoma, implant asymmetry, and capsular contracture. Pooling of statistical data was performed when possible. The authors reviewed 30 articles regarding five different types of pocket locations for gluteal implants described since 1969. The most common complications after gluteal augmentation surgery using implants are wound dehiscence (10.29%), seroma (2.49%), wound infection (1.12%), and hematoma (0.24%). Fulfilled expectations after surgery were assessed differently among studies and could not be compared. The pocket locations for gluteal augmentation surgery with implants that have the lowest complication rates are the following: intramuscular XZY method (13.18%), sub-muscular (17.60%), intramuscular (18.05%), and subfascial (54.84%).

A porcine full-thickness wound model was used to compare six topical treatments: platelet-poor plasma; platelet-rich plasma; autologous adipose stem cells plus platelet-poor plasma; autologous adipose stem cells plus platelet-rich plasma; allogeneic adipose stem cells containing green fluorescent protein plus platelet-poor plasma; and saline (control). One week after isolation, adipose stem cells were applied to full-thickness wounds on the paraspinal and thoracic regions of three pigs (44 wounds per pig; each treatment was applied to eight separate wounds). Each wound was monitored over 21 days for closure, cosmesis, and histopathology. There was no significant difference in the reepithelialization rate, but treatments containing adipose stem cells demonstrated increased microvessel densities (31.75 +/- 5.73 vessels/cm2 versus 7.93 +/- 3.61 vessels/cm2) compared with groups without adipose stem cells. Wound cosmesis was improved in the adipose stem cell plus platelet-rich plasma group compared with other treatment groups (p < 0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor levels detected in matrices containing adipose stem cells were approximately 7-fold higher compared with platelet-rich plasma or platelet-poor plasma (p < 0.05). Localization of transgenic green fluorescent protein plus adipose stem cells indicated incorporation near neovasculature. In normal healing wounds, adipose stem cells appear to enhance the healing process only when provided in a fibrin gel vehicle containing a number of complementary wound-healing trophic factors. Perivascular adipose stem cell localization suggests a function in enhancing blood supply through providing physical and paracrine support to newly forming vessels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19182664/

These implants must be placed in a safe and reproducible plane of anatomic dissection for a successful long-term outcome. Poor implant placement techniques result in greater complications such as asymmetry, implant migration, capsular contracture, and infection. This article discusses (1) the history and the evolution of body-contouring implants, (2) the different techniques and dissection planes in which to put the implants in the calf, gluteal, pectoral, and triceps/biceps areas, and (3) the complications associated with the different implantation techniques. The different anatomical areas that have been treated with solid silicone implants are the gluteus, pectoral, calf, deltoids, biceps, triceps, and trapezium.

A retrospective chart review of all patients (n = 376) undergoing primary surgery for craniosynostosis was conducted. The charts were analyzed for diagnosis, sex, syndromic involvement, age at operation, type of fixation, complications, and reoperations. Complications were defined as any event requiring prolonged hospitalization or readmission secondary to the surgical procedure, reoperation, or mortality. Reoperative rates were classified into major (e.g., repeat craniotomy, cranioplasty) or minor (e.g., hardware removal, wound closure). After excluding patients for length of follow-up less than 6 months (n = 23), inadequate verification of all data (n = 21), and prior neurosurgical craniectomy (n = 18), a total of 314 patients were identified.

Exhibit knowledge of developments in imaging and analysis alternatives. Interest in the dimensions of the human head has been present since antiquity. Proportional analysis and measures from cadaveric specimens led to the development of radiologic image capture and analysis on living subjects. These techniques were originally applied to establishing normative values, documenting growth, and diagnosing dentofacial disharmonies. This article reviews the origins of cephalometric methodology and current developments and applications. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search and review of all English language articles using the keywords ""cephalometric"" and ""cephalometrics."" Cephalometrics have undergone substantial use and development since the introduction of radiologic imaging on living human subjects in 1931. Although frequently associated with orthognathic surgery, cephalometrics have been applied to a number of conditions involving altered craniofacial morphology. Advances in imaging and computing have led to increased interest in three-dimensional and non-x-ray-based assessment of the human head. Mathematical models have been applied to standard cephalometric information to increase the descriptive accuracy of the complex shapes involved. Cephalometric techniques and analyses are versatile tools that can be applied to a wide variety of clinical scenarios involving the craniofacial region.

There are multiple theories as to the causes of the hyperplasia, which include temporalis hyperactivity, hormonal stimulus, and genetic inheritance. The resulting excess growth of the coronoids results in impingement on the zygomatic processes leading to mandibular hypomobility. The diagnosis is confirmed with plain films and computed tomography scans. Treatment involves bilateral coronoidectomies to relieve impingement on the zygoma. Postoperative physical therapy is crucial for success; the therapy focuses on maintaining the mouth opening achieved at the time of surgery.

Some studies suggest that once heat-adapted, such implants under certain conditions tend to partially revert to their preadapted shape, termed a ""memory effect."" We investigated this phenomenon by using heat-adapted 82:18 poly-L-lactic acid:polyglycolic acid copolymer mesh panel and plate specimens with a glass transition temperature of 57 degrees C. The specimens retained limited malleability even at temperatures as low as 45 degrees C, substantially below the nominal glass transition temperature, as measured by shape relaxation experiments. At 40 degrees C to 42 degrees C, however, shape relaxation was not observed. A three-dimensional synthetic bone construct was also fixated using 90 degrees C heat-adapted plates, then incubated in a 37 degrees C buffer bath for 4 weeks, with periodic measurement of the shape of the construct. No changes in shape were recorded over this interval, suggesting that heat-adapted bioabsorbable implants forming a three-dimensional fixation network with multiple bone fragments cannot independently shape relax with the overall interconnectedness of the network ensuring its stability over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17538315/

Many types of bioabsorbable fixation have been applied to this procedure, including bioabsorbable suture coupled with a bioabsorbable bone anchor, with excellent outcomes. Typically, the anchor and suture materials differ, each having their own hydrolytic strength loss profile. The dynamic relationship between the instantaneous state of degradation of the bone anchor and the suture components can affect fixation strength and failure mode, a poorly understood phenomenon. We examined the use of 2x5 mm PLLA-PGA (82:18) copolymer screws containing a suture eyelet in the head, paired with one of four types of bioabsorbable suture (2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 and 3-0 PDS-II), in a model system designed to mimic brow lift fixation. Constructs were inserted into a synthetic bone substrate and incubated in pH 7.4 buffer at 37 degrees C for up to 3 weeks, then loaded to failure. Initial failure loads were dependent upon suture size but not suture material, with 2-0 suture constructs (63-70N) failing at twice the load of the 3-0 suture constructs (30-35N). The following 3 week strength retentions were obtained: 40-55% for 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture, 100% for 3-0 PDS-II suture, and 58% for 2-0 PDS-II suture constructs. The predominant failure mode was suture breakage at the knot, with the later intervals utilizing 2-0 PDS-II suture including some screw head failures.

There are several unique aspects of bioabsorbable polymers that can enhance their versatility. One of these is the application of heat to adapt the implant. Hot-tip cautery has been used for years to cut and otherwise customize bioabsorbable implants intraoperatively. As the tips of these devices can reach temperatures of over 1,000 degrees C, there is the potential that such practice can modify the degradation properties of these polymers. This study was performed to better understand the extent to which this potential exists. Screw heads of an 82:18 poly-L-lactic acid and poly-glycolic acid copolymer were modified by repeated passage of a hot-tip cautery wire, deforming the hex geometry to that of a ball. There was no significant difference between the glass transition temperature (approximately 59 degrees C) and inherent viscosity (approximately 1.45 dL/g) of treated and untreated screw heads, indicating no overall change in these properties throughout the mass of the screw head. Additionally, these properties were measured and comparisons made between the treated screw heads and untreated plates made of the same polymer during 28-day exposure to an in vitro bath (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). The glass transition temperature and inherent viscosity exhibited declines during this period, with no significant differences between the two groups.

Know the composition and biology of injectable fillers. 2. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each injectable filler. 3. Understand the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory status of each type of injectable filler, including their indications. The use of injectable filling agents for soft-tissue facial defects has a long history of successful use based on xenogeneic collagen materials. New materials of differing compositions for injection treatments either are now available or will soon be available for clinical use. A review of the medical literature was performed to provide chemical compositions, methods of preparation, biological behavior, and clinical outcomes for every known injectable filler material that is either currently used or being evaluated in clinical trials. Hyaluronic acid-based materials have now replaced animal or human-derived collagen as the standard injection materials. Synthetic alternatives offer the potential of longer lasting results, but the long-term outcome with their use in large numbers of patients is not yet known. As there is no single injectable filler that has all of the desired characteristics, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of one filler over another is extremely helpful in guiding the patient to an informed decision.

Tertiary academic medical center, Craniofacial Program at Children's Hospital. Four patients with nasopharyngeal stenosis were treated with a preoperatively fabricated stent made from a clasped palatal appliance onto which hollow acrylic conduits were extended through surgically re-created pharyngeal ports. A subsequent set of four patients with nasopharyngeal stenosis were treated with intraoperatively-fashioned silastic grommets, as opposed to palatal appliances. Postoperative intraoral stenting of nasopharyngeal ports. Maintenance of pharyngeal port opening after 1 year, improvement in nasal airway obstructive symptoms. The palatal appliance stents were less well tolerated and had a lower maintenance of port patency after device removal (4 of 8, 50%). The silastic grommets provided better retention into the ports and increased patient tolerance, as well as better 1-year port maintenance (6 of 8, 75%). The grommet stent appliance offers numerous advantages over a conventional dental-clasped appliance for prosthetic nasopharyngeal stenting, including obviation of extensive preoperative preparation, ease of insertion and removal, and exchange of air during the stenting period.

Using 1.5-mm diameter screws made of an oriented copolymer of 82% poly-L-lactic acid and 18% polyglycolic acid (LactoSorb copolymer), screw dimensions were measured before and after soaking in an in vitro pH 7.4, 37 degrees C buffer environment. After 33 days of exposure to buffer, there were no changes in the physical appearance of the screws, and there was no change in dimensions or shape. The orientation of polymer materials in a bioabsorbable screw device improves its strength and can retard the rate of hydrolysis. However, the residual stresses in oriented screws theoretically can potentiate dimensional shift in the implants during hydrolysis. That such shift did not occur during the early phase of hydrolysis provides further evidence of the mechanism by which these types of screws can maintain biomechanical function throughout the bone-healing phase of the craniofacial skeleton.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16633183/

Resorbable plates and screws have been widely accepted for use in pediatric craniofacial surgery, including FOA. We have applied the concept of extended resorbable spanning plates to FOA for metopic, unilateral, and bilateral coronal synostosis in infants and children during a 5-year period. We report on 60 patients, ages 4 to 15 months (mean, 7 months); 28 girls, 32 boys. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months (mean, 24 months). There were no structural failures, no infections, and no complications related to the use of extended spanning plates. Extended spanning plates decrease mobility between bone segments, confer greater stability to the construct, and reduce both the number of plates and of screws that are necessary and reduce the operative time. Application of these plates simplifies FOA surgery and represents a step in the evolution of plating technology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16633169/

Approximately two thirds of their initial strength was retained by 6 weeks. In clinical testing, 10 patients undergoing cranial vault reconstruction were treated by 1.5-mm resorbable plates secured by rivets. Although postoperative clinical outcomes were unaffected, good engagement of the devices with secure plate fixation was obtained in only about 70% of the rivets fired. Although the novel approach of a pull-back rivet was encouraging in both design and in vitro testing, its clinical use is impaired by the sensitivity of the device to the thickness of the bone into which it is placed, as well as its larger diameter compared with resorbable screws.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16432401/

A recent strategy to promote the wound-healing cascade is to prepare an autologous platelet concentrate suspended in plasma, also known as platelet-rich plasma, that contains growth factors and administer it to wound sites. The purpose of this study was to quantitate platelet number and growth factors released from a prepared platelet concentrate. Whole blood was drawn from 10 healthy patients undergoing cosmetic surgery and concentrated into platelet-rich plasma. Platelet counts on whole blood and platelet-rich plasma were determined using a Cell-Dyn 3200. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB, transforming growth factor-beta1, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were measured in the platelet-rich plasma using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. In addition, platelet activation during the concentration procedure was analyzed by measuring P selectin values in blood serum. An 8-fold increase in platelet concentration was found in the platelet-rich plasma compared with that of whole blood (baseline whole blood, 197 +/- 42 x 10 platelets/microl; platelet concentrate, 1600 +/- 330 x 10 platelets/microl). The concentration of growth factors also increased with increasing platelet number. However, growth factor concentration varied from patient to patient. On average for the whole blood as compared with platelet-rich plasma, the platelet-derived growth factor-BB concentration increased from 3.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml to 17 +/- 8 ng/ml, transforming growth factor-beta1 concentration increased from 35 +/- 8 ng/ml to 120 +/- 42 ng/ml, vascular endothelial growth factor concentration increased from 155 +/- 110 pg/ml to 955 +/- 1030 pg/ml, and endothelial growth factor concentration increased from 129 +/- 61 pg/ml to 470 +/- 320 pg/ml.

Because of the young age of many treated craniosynostosis patients and the unique pattern of cranial vault growth, the extensive implantation of metal devices is potentially problematic. The use of resorbable plate and screw devices offers all of the benefits of rigid fixation without many of their potential risks. Since the introduction of resorbable plate and screw devices in 1996, tens of thousands of craniofacial patients have received implants, but long-term results from a large series have yet to be reported. A combined prospective and retrospective analysis was done on 1883 craniosynostosis patients under 2 years of age treated by 12 surgeons from seven different geographic locations over a 5-year period who used the same type of resorbable bone fixation devices (poly-L-lacticpolyglycolic copolymer). Specifically, the incidence of postoperative infection, fixation device failure, occurrence of delayed foreign-body reactions, and the need for reoperation resulting from device-related problems were determined. Technical difficulties and trends in device use were also noted. From this series, significant infectious complications occurred in 0.2 percent, device instability primarily resulting from postoperative trauma occurred in 0.3 percent, and self-limiting local foreign-body reactions occurred in 0.7 percent of the treated patients. The overall reoperation rate attributable to identifiable device-related problems was 0.3 percent. Improved bony stability was gained by using the longest plate geometries/configurations possible and bone grafting any significant gaps across plated areas that were structurally important. The specific types of plates and screws used evolved over the study period from simple plates, meshes, and threaded screws to application-specific plates and threadless push screws whose use varied among the involved surgeons. This report documents the safety and long-term value of the use of resorbable (LactoSorb) plate and screw fixation in pediatric craniofacial surgery in the infant and young child. Device-related complications requiring reoperation occurred in less than 0.5 percent of the implanted patients, which is less frequent than is reported for metallic bone fixation. Resorbable bone fixation for the rapidly growing cranial vault has fewer potential complications than the traditional use of metal plates, screws, and wires.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15468389/

This study investigated the influence of temperature on hydrolysis and found that a variance from 37 degrees C to as little as 2 degrees C can affect the rate of hydrolysis of a PGA/PLLA copolymer about 25-30%, with the rate increasing with increasing temperature. As most animals of biomedical interest have a body temperature on the order of 1-3 degrees C greater than that of humans, it is possible that animal testing may be ""worst case""; that is, strength loss may be accelerated in animals relative to that in human patients.

The surface coatings (three treated, one untreated) consisted of a base-powdered material of calcium sodium phosphate (Osteostim, EBI, NJ), which were applied by different methods (pressed, brushed, one-sided versus two-sided). Evaluation consisted of cross-sectional histologic assessment of the cranial detects determining the quantitative bony fill and the presence of residual polymer material and calcium sodium phosphate. This study produced the following findings: (1) cranial defect regeneration occurs faster with calcium-coated membranes and is complete by 3 months; (2) no difference could be seen between the different methods of calcium sodium phosphate coating; (3) the calcium sodium phosphate coatings did not inhibit resorption of the biodegradable membranes for those systems that had coatings on one side; however, systems completely covered showed delayed resorption; and (4) the calcium sodium phosphate coatings did not produce any inflammatory reactions. These findings suggest that, in addition to inhibiting connective tissue from entering the wound site, the calcium coatings on resorbable devices may have beneficial effects in selected clinical conditions, especially in conditions where faster bone regeneration is necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12218798/

Seven patients who had large nonmalignant bony lesions of the anterior cranial vault and orbit underwent simultaneous bony excision and reconstruction with preoperatively fabricated custom alloplastic implants. Preoperatively, a 3D computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained from which an anatomical model was fabricated. On the anatomical model, the predicted amount of bone excision was performed. The defect in the model was then used to create an alloplastic (HTR polymer) implant for reconstruction and surgical placement. At the time of surgery, the implant was secured into position with either metal or resorbable plates and screws. In cases where the frontal sinus was in proximity to the implant, it was either cranialized and covered with a pericranial flap or obliterated with hydroxyapatite cement. All computer-generated implants required some modification intraoperatively due to a larger amount of bony excision than was preoperatively planned. This was accomplished by modifying the sterile back-up of the implant as an addition to the original implant or completing reconstruction of the bony defect with hydroxyapatite cement. All patients have healed uneventfully with a minimum of 1 year follow-up (average, 2.6 years). In all cases, excellent contours have been maintained and all patients have remained infection-free. In the management of large benign bony tumors of the cranio-orbital region, simultaneous reconstruction with custom implants fabricated from porous, hydrophilic HTR polymer can be preoperatively fabricated based on an estimate of the subsequent bony defect. The successful use of this approach depends on a favorable tissue quality of the recipient site, a generous preoperative estimate of the amount of bone that will be resected so that the implant is adequate, intraoperative techniques of expanding the implant reconstruction, and intraoperative methods to assure a partitioning of the implant from the frontal sinus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12218793/

Coincident with the presence of internal fixation devices, it may be necessary to use radiotherapy to treat tumors. While metal implants can alter the distribution of the radiotherapy beam, bioabsorbable polymer implants are, essentially, tissue equivalent. This ionizing irradiation, in sufficiently high dose, can affect polymers through chain scission and cross-linking and accelerate the hydrolysis of absorbable polymers. However, little is known about the effects of therapeutic doses on such materials. This study exposed LactoSorb (Biomet, Inc., Warsaw, IN) absorbable copolymer to doses of x-ray irradiation in a clinically relevant manner, in vitro, with individual doses of 2 Gy administered five days per week for up to eight weeks, yielding a total cumulative dose of up to 80 Gy. Specimens were tested both mechanically and for inherent viscosity. Overall, the LactoSorb specimens withstood exposure to the irradiation exceedingly well, providing empirical evidence of the suitability of this material for temporary internal fixation when subsequent radiotherapy in the region is probable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12140421/

In either case, the object remains as part of the wound and is highly conspicuous. These injuries are much more common on the trunk and extremities because of their larger surface areas and the relative ease in which the object may penetrate them without lethal consequences. In the face, however, such injuries are more rare because of protective reflexes that either move the face away from the coming object or permit it only to be deflected away without being embedded. In addition, the face presents a much smaller target than the rest of the body and, therefore, is more infrequently impaled.

Fourteen patients who had large (> 150 cm2) preexisting defects of the cranium or cranio-orbital region underwent surgical reconstruction. Preoperatively, a three-dimensional computed tomographic scan was obtained from which an anatomic model was fabricated. The defect in the model was then used to create an alloplastic (hard tissue-replacement polymer) implant for reconstruction and surgical placement. At the time of surgery, the implant was secured into position with either metal or resorbable fixation. In cases where the frontal sinus was in proximity to the implant, the frontal sinus was either cranialized and covered with a pericranial flap or obliterated with hydroxyapatite cement. In cases that had been previously irradiated or infected, wide bony debridement and coverage with a vascularized muscle was initially performed, followed by implant reconstruction 6 months later. All implants fit easily into the bone defects, and only four (29 percent) required some minor adjustments to complete the fit. All patients healed uneventfully. With a minimum of 1 year follow-up (average, 3 years) in all cases, excellent contours have been maintained and all patients have remained infection-free. In large cranial defects, custom implants fabricated from porous, hydrophilic hard-tissue replacement polymer provide an exacting anatomic fit and a solid stable reconstruction. This method of reconstruction in these defects is rapid and exact, and significantly reduces operative time. Critical attention must be paid, however, to management of the frontal sinus and preexisting bone infection and the quality of the overlying soft-tissue cover.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11884798/

Split-thickness skin grafts were placed in the wake of the flaps. Patient follow-up ranged from 2 to 78 months. All wounds healed, and 10 of 11 limbs were salvaged. Bipedicle flap coverage allows reconstruction of soft-tissue defects with the transposition of local tissues of similar qualities, avoiding the need for more complex distant tissue reconstruction. The inclusion of the deep fascia with the flap enhances its vascular perfusion, even in the ischemic lower extremity, with concurrent revascularization.

The mandibular sagittal split osteotomies involved advancements (11/20), setbacks (5/20), and asymmetric rotation (4/20). Three patients had simultaneous genioplasties, which were also stabilized with resorbable fixation. All maxillae were fixed with four 2.0-mm L-shaped plates and screws. The mandibular rami were maintained with three 2.5-mm bicortical screws per side. The mandibular symphyseal segments were held in position with two or three 2.5 mm bicortical screws.

These arch dimensions were then compared with the reported data for a nongrafted group and a noncleft group of 8-year-old children. The major findings were: 1) that the dental arches of both cleft groups generally demonstrated a significant diminution in length and width (P < 0.05) compared with the noncleft groups, and 2) that the patients who underwent primary alveolar cleft bone grafting showed no statistically significant difference for any arch dimension (P < 0.05) when compared with the nongrafted group lacking this additional surgical procedure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10388428/

The soft tissues of the hindlimb were transected at the proximal thigh with the femoral artery, vein and femur left intact. The femoral vessels were clamped and guanethidine was infused into a branch of the femoral artery of the right leg of each animal, while saline was injected into the left leg. The clamps were removed after 15 minutes. A baseline preoperative injection of radiolabeled microspheres was made, and subsequent injections at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperation. Twelve rats (Group II) were then used to assess the amount of arterial-venous shunting preoperatively (n = 6) and at 18 hours postoperation (n = 6), by venous sampling. Blood flow to both limbs increased postoperation, but there was significantly more flow in the guanethidine treated limb at 18 and 24 hours postoperation. The amount of shunting was approximately 50% in both limbs at 18 hours, as compared to 10% preoperation. These results highlight the potential benefit of guanethidine and other sympathetic blocking agents in reimplantation to increase blood flow, decrease tissue ischemia and increase anastomotic patency rates.

Despite its success in a vascular setting, mechanical coupling device nerve repair remains to be studied. Forty-five male rats were tested over 7- and 14-week study periods. One half of the animals underwent primary suture repairs for transected sciatic nerves, and the remainder of the animals had their nerves repaired using a mechanical coupling device. Postoperative analysis consisted of histological evaluation of pre- and postrepair site nerve morphology (axonal continuity and counts) as well as functional testing using walking track analysis. Mechanical coupling device coaptation of the nerves using the epineurium was done in approximately one half the time compared with conventional suturing. After both 7 and 14 weeks postoperatively, walking track analysis showed no difference in the amount of functional return between the two repair groups. No animal exhibited complete return of function. Axonal continuity occurred across both repairs without significant difference in their pre- and postrepair axonal counts.

Matched serum haptoglobin assays were obtained immediately prior to and after the laser treatments intraoperatively. Combined with the testing for hemosiderin from urine samples collected within 2 hours postoperatively, the amount of intravascular hemolysis present after early photothermolysis was assessed. Mean preoperative haptoglobin levels were within normal ranges (116 +/- 13 mg/dl), which then averaged a 9.5 percent decrease (105 +/- 8 mg/dl) at the conclusion of laser therapy. The decline in haptoglobin levels was higher in the youngest patient but did not exceed the renal threshold for hemoglobin. No evidence of hemoglobin was found in the urine or urine sediment of any patient. These results indicate that although hemoglobinemia does occur after port-wine stains ablation with the flashlamp pulsed-dye laser, the level of intravascular hemolysis obtained is not injurious to the infant or child with large cutaneous involvement.

Utilizing wire fixation across a curved osteotomy site of an acrylic bar fixed at one end, compressive loading at the suspended end was used to test the resistance of the ligatures to stretch failure. Twenty-eight- and 30-gauge ligature patterns tested included single loops, double loops, and figure-eights across both 1- and 2-cm distances. A two-way analysis of variance was then used to determine the various effects of wire diameter, configuration, and loop length. The extensional deformation of ligature fixation was shown to be reduced by increasing the number of wire loops, reducing intraloop distances, or employing a slightly larger gauge diameter. The complex wiring configuration of a figure-eight technique was of no advantage over simple wire loops. In comparative strengths, two double loops were stronger than one double loop, and two single loops were stronger than one single loop or figure-eight. Comparable reductions in fixation strength were seen in all groups; there were larger intrabony distances between the burr holes or with the smaller gauge wire.

Twenty-one 21-day-old kittens were equally divided into the following three groups: a control, a unilaterally enucleated, and an enucleated-expanded group. Postoperative three-dimensional computed tomographic scans were obtained at 5 months of age immediately before study termination. Linear orbital, orbitomaxillary, and zygomaticomaxillary dimensions were measured on the scans and compared at necropsy with orbital volume assessment on the dry skulls. Control animal orbits averaged 21.5 mm in height, 21.0 mm in width, and 5.1 cm3 in orbital volume, and an orbitomaxillary-zygomaticomaxillary height-to-width ratio of 31.0: 24.5.

The grafts were mixed with either basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone or dextran beads that had been pretreated with bFGF. The grafts were then compared by weight and histology at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Although graft weights were nearly comparable at 1 month, substantial differences were seen at 6 months, with the bead-containing grafts exhibiting near complete weight maintenance and better overall graft form. Histologically, the bead-containing grafts had extensive intercellular collagen formation and a heterogeneity of adipocyte cell sizes, particularly after 1 month. These findings suggest that the addition of cell-specific bioactive peptides that affect either the preadipocyte cell line and/or the fibroblastic components of the recipient site improve postoperative fat graft weight maintenance. Delivery of the biochemical agent appears to require a carrier system to exert its effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1374121/

Iliac grafts were onlayed on the parietal bone bilaterally and immobilized with wire ligatures in 15 animals. NGF and a control solution were introduced into the grafts through subcutaneous osmotic pumps. After 60 days, graft survival was compared by weights, histology, and fluorochrome labels. NGF-treated grafts were characterized by an average of 88.4% weight retention, preservation of the outer cortical plate with firm fixation to the underlying calvarium, and fluorescent labels localized to the inner cortex. Conversely, control grafts had an average weight retention of 42.8% (p < 0.01), nearly complete outer cortical plate loss with increased mobility of the residual inner cortex, and a lack of fluorescence in any part of the grafts. Despite the incongruous name, NGF exhibited a beneficial effect on onlay bone graft volume maintenance in this study.

Almost all aspects of the bony orbit can be reached with the exception of the frontal bone superior to the supraorbital rim. When wide exposure of the orbital skeleton is necessary, a bicoronal scalp flap is most effective in a nonalopecic patient. The inferior orbit can be approached by a ciliary, blepharoplasty, or conjunctival incision with a lateral canthotomy.

Addition of VPF to cultures of vascular endothelial cells in vitro unexpectedly stimulated cellular proliferation. VPF promoted the growth of new blood vessels when administered into healing rabbit bone grafts or rat corneas. The identity of the growth factor activity with VPF was established in four ways: (a) the molecular weight of the activity in preparative SDS-PAGE was the same as VPF (Mr approximately 40 kD); (b) multiple isoforms (pI greater than or equal to 8) for both VPF and the growth-promoting activity were observed; (c) a single, unique NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained; (d) both growth factor and permeability-enhancing activities were immunoadsorbed using antipeptide IgG that recognized the amino terminus of VPF. Furthermore, 125I-VPF was shown to bind specifically and with high affinity to endothelial cells in vitro and could be chemically cross-linked to a high-molecular weight cell surface receptor, thus demonstrating a mechanism whereby VPF can interact directly with endothelial cells.

Suturing of the reapproximated margins did not appear to promote healing or provide much strength beyond the properties of the suture material. Dermal grafts, fixed by suturing, induced healing by becoming incorporated into the disc, restoring discal continuity, and approximating normal disc strength. The use of laser-assisted tissue welding for dermal graft fixation was found to be inadequate and was subsequently abandoned. Fascial grafts could be fixed into position by both suture and laser-assistance, but consistently failed to exhibit successful transplantation and promote healing at the disc site.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2656940/
pubmed,2921658,Effect of different surgical repair modalities on regeneration of the rabbit mandibular nerve.,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,1989,B L Eppley; M J Doucet; T Winkelmann; J J Delfino,10.1016/0278-2391(89)90229-2,"A study was designed to evaluate the ability of the rabbit mandibular nerve to regenerate when exposed to crush and resection injuries, as well as to determine how differently sized resection injuries healed when repaired with either autogenous grafts or laminin-lined collagen tubulization. The nerve demonstrated a regenerative capacity over a 1-cm defect, with morphology and function that approximated normals, but could not span a 2-cm gap defect unaided. Crush injuries produced findings that were inferior to both those in normal nerves and in those with resections. In 1-cm defects, both grafting and tubular repairs produced similar results, with substantial recovery of neural function after 16 weeks. In 2-cm defects, autogenous grafting was superior to tubulization by both morphologic and functional assessment. Replacement of the lateral cortex of the mandible after nerve repair was shown to be unnecessary. The implications of these findings as they relate to nerve injury and repair in humans is discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2921658/

Electrophysiologic assessment of function revealed no significant difference between the two techniques. Histological differences were apparent, however, early postoperatively from the effects of heat energy on the perimeter of fascicular morphology. At a later stage, this effect had disappeared. The laser technique was also associated with an apparent decreased escape and entrapment of axons.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2497212/

Preoperative and postoperative findings (greater than 24 months follow-up) relating to mandibular mobility, pain, and stability of occlusion were compared. Both procedures resulted in a reduction in symptoms, but differences in postoperative findings were observed. Each procedure resulted in increased translation, with eminectomy patients exhibiting greater opening distances at endstage evaluation. In addition, a greater incidence of residual deviation to the affected side occurred in the majority of high condylectomy patients. Although pain was reduced in both groups, less residual pain was observed in the eminectomy group. Alteration in maxillomandibular centric relation was a rare finding, seen only in two high condylectomy patients. Possible factors contributing to these differences are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3166041/

Block cortical grafts harvested from the ilium were implanted into sites in the mandibular ramus or body. The basic fibroblast growth factor was continuously introduced over a period of 14 days through subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Increased vascularity, as assessed by vessel number and depth of penetration into the grafts, was noted at 10 days postoperatively in the bFGF stimulated side as compared to contralateral control grafts. At the fourteenth postoperative day, bFGF administration was discontinued and a decrease in angiogenesis was noted over the ensuing 2 weeks so that after 1 postoperative month, little difference could be detected between the stimulated and nonstimulated grafts. Assessment of osseous healing at the 1 month postoperative interval using triple fluorochrome labeling did not reveal evidence of accelerated osteogenesis on the previously stimulated side.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2452866/

Abnormalities of the hard and soft tissue structures of the joints were determined radiographically and compared with the findings of surgical examination. Polydirectional tomography and microfocus magnification compared favorably with each other, as well as in their ability to show the actual abnormalities. Arthrography had a high degree of correlation with actual pathologic disc alterations, except for the 15% incidence of false-positive findings of perforation.
