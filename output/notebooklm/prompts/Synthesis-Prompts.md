# Synthesis Prompts

### Research Synthesis
> “Combine findings from PubMed papers and OpenAlex entries about craniofacial or implant techniques.  
Identify consensus points, trends, and notable innovations over time.”

### Cross-Media Summary
> “Compare what Dr. Eppley says in blog Q&As versus what appears in peer-reviewed literature.  
Highlight where advice to patients aligns or diverges from research findings.”

### FAQ Creation
> “Create a 15-20 question FAQ summarizing common patient inquiries and Eppley’s responses.  
Each answer should be 2–3 sentences with at least one citation.”

### Risk-Benefit Table
> “List each procedure discussed in the corpus.  
Add two short columns: key benefits and main risks as cited by Eppley.  
Cite the paragraph source.”

### Recovery Best Practices
> “Summarize recovery guidance across all Q&A posts.  
Group by body area and cite representative examples.”
